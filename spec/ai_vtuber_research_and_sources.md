## 2. Deep Dive: Architectural Insights from `LocalAIVtuber2`

Analyzing [0Xiaohei0/LocalAIVtuber2](https://github.com/0Xiaohei0/LocalAIVtuber2) revealed several critical design patterns that distinguish successful interactive AI companions from naive conversational wrappers.

### 2.1 The Task Pipeline Manager Pattern

Naive implementations attempt to manage speech, LLM streaming, and audio as ad-hoc async callbacks. In contrast, `LocalAIVtuber2` implements a decoupled, stateful `PipelineManager` (`frontend/src/lib/pipelineManager.ts`) tracking the lifecycle of dialogue turns:

```
[User Speech] -> [VAD / ASR] 
                     |
                     v
             +---------------+
             |  Task Created |
             +---------------+
                     |
                     v
             +---------------+
             |  LLM Started  | -> Streams text tokens
             +---------------+
                     |
                     v
             +---------------+
             |  LLM Finished | -> Splitted into discrete response chunks
             +---------------+
                     |
                     v
             +---------------+
             |  TTS Finished | -> Audio synthesized per chunk
             +---------------+
                     |
                     v
             +---------------+
             | Playback Done | -> Triggered chunk-by-chunk on `audio.onended`
             +---------------+
```

#### Task State Machine
Each dialogue unit undergoes state transitions:
1. `created`: Audio input transcribed, task queued.
2. `llm_started`: Token generation initiated.
3. `llm_finished`: Complete textual response generated and chunked by punctuation boundaries.
4. `tts_finished`: All textual segments mapped to discrete audio URLs (`response.audio = audioUrl`).
5. `task_finished`: All audio segments have finished physical playback through the sound card (`audio.onended`).

### 2.2 Granular Decoupling of Generation vs. Playback
In `LocalAIVtuber2`, the TTS generation loop and audio playback loop operate as two independent worker routines subscribed to the pipeline:
- `getNextTaskForTTS()` finds any text item that has not yet had audio generated (`res.text && !res.audio`).
- `getNextTaskForAudio()` finds the next sequential item that possesses audio but hasn't completed playback (`res.audio && !res.playback_finished`).

**Why this matters**:
Generation runs ahead of playback. While segment 1 is playing to the user, segment 2 is already synthesizing in the background. The user hears speech immediately without waiting for the full dialogue to synthesize, and playback transitions smoothly without gaps.

### 2.3 Three-Tier Interruption State Machine
Barge-in (interrupting the AI mid-sentence when the user begins speaking) is one of the hardest challenges in conversational AI. `LocalAIVtuber2` uses a 3-flag state machine:
```typescript
task.interruptionState = { tts: false, llm: false, audio: false };
```
When user speech probability exceeds threshold ($\ge 0.3$):
1. **LLM Abort**: Cancels the generator stream.
2. **TTS Abort**: Triggers `AbortController.abort()` to drop pending synthesis HTTP requests.
3. **Audio Abort**: Executes `audio.pause(); audio.currentTime = 0; audio = null;` to immediately cut off physical sound playback.
4. Once all three subsystems acknowledge the interrupt flag, the task transitions to `"cancelled"`.

### 2.4 Hybrid Web Audio Routing for Morph-Target Lip Sync
Direct `<audio>` playback in HTML5 bypasses the Web Audio graph by default. `LocalAIVtuber2` attaches the audio element to an `AudioContext` via `createMediaElementSource`:
```typescript
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const source = audioContext.createMediaElementSource(audio);
const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();
analyser.fftSize = 256;
source.connect(analyser);
analyser.connect(audioContext.destination);
```
During playback, an animation loop samples `analyser.getByteFrequencyData()`, calculates the average amplitude, and normalizes it to a `ttsLiveVolume` float ($0.0 \dots 1.0$) passed to the 3D VRM model or Live2D cubism parameter to drive mouth open/close morph targets.

## 3. Subtitle & Dialogue Synchronization Models

Conversational AI companions must present dialogue subtitles that mirror natural speech timing. During our implementation and benchmarking, four approaches were evaluated:

| Approach | Latency Impact | Boundary Accuracy | Implementation Complexity | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Monolithic Streaming + Byte Tracking** | 0 ms | ❌ Catastrophic (5x-15x faster than real-time) | Low | **Failed**: Network burst rate does not equal audio playback rate. |
| **2. Synthetic Animation Timers** | 0 ms | ❌ Drifts over long sentences ($\pm 1.5\text{s}$) | Medium | **Failed**: Fixed word-rate calculations fail to capture prosody and pauses. |
| **3. Word-Level Forced Alignment** | +500ms to +1500ms | ✅ Exact millisecond phoneme accuracy | High (requires ASR alignment server) | **Overkill**: High server latency penalty for real-time conversation. |
| **4. Discrete Sentence Segmenting (Adopted)** | <50ms (parallel TTS) | ✅ 100% Guaranteed Physical Boundaries | Medium | **Ideal**: Zero boundary drift, instant transitions on `audio.onended`. |

### The Chosen Model: Discrete Sentence Segmentation
1. **Server Splitter**: Splits LLM responses at natural punctuation boundaries (`.`, `!`, `?`, `\n`) into units not exceeding 14–18 words (strictly 2 visual lines).
2. **Parallel TTS Synthesis**: All segments are synthesized in parallel using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, yielding base64 RIFF WAV blobs.
3. **Sequential Hardware Queue**: Segments play one after another using native `HTMLAudioElement`.
4. **Proportional Word Brightening**: Within the active segment, the active word index is calculated via:
   $$\text{Progress} = \frac{\text{audio.currentTime}}{\text{audio.duration}}$$
   $$\text{Word Index} = \lfloor \text{Progress} \times N_{\text{words}} \rfloor$$
5. **Deterministic Transition**: The subtitle lines hold steadily on screen throughout the audio and flip to the next segment strictly when `audio.onended` fires.

## 4. VRM 3D Character & Lip-Sync Integration

### 4.1 Audio Analysis Pipeline
To drive facial expressions and mouth movements on a 3D VRM avatar, audio data must be inspected without introducing latency or audio artifacts:

```
[Base64 WAV] -> [HTMLAudioElement]
                       |
        [createMediaElementSource]
                       |
                       v
               +---------------+
               |   GainNode    | -> Volume control & mute management
               +---------------+
                       |
                       v
               +---------------+
               | AnalyserNode  | -> FFT frequency & RMS energy extraction
               +---------------+
                       |
                       v
            [audioContext.destination] -> Speaker hardware
```

### 4.2 Formant Frequency Binning vs. Volume Morphing
Two methods exist for mapping audio to VRM blendshapes:

1. **RMS Energy Volume Morphing (Simple & Robust)**:
   - Calculates root-mean-square amplitude of current audio buffer.
   - Maps normalized RMS directly to VRM mouth expression `aa` (open mouth).
   - Adds smooth easing: `currentBlend = lerp(currentBlend, targetRMS, 0.4)`.

2. **Formant Spectrum Analysis (Vowel Formant Formats: A, I, U, E, O)**:
   - Evaluates specific frequency bands from the FFT:
     - **A (aa)**: Formant around $700 - 1000\text{ Hz}$
     - **I (ih)**: Formant around $200 - 400\text{ Hz}$ and $2000 - 3000\text{ Hz}$
     - **U (ou)**: Formant around $200 - 400\text{ Hz}$ with low high-frequency presence
     - **E (ee)**: Formant around $400 - 600\text{ Hz}$ and $1800 - 2400\text{ Hz}$
     - **O (oh)**: Formant around $400 - 600\text{ Hz}$ with low second formant
   - Weighted blendshape values are updated each frame in the `requestAnimationFrame` render loop.

## 5. Visual Styling & Anime UI Typography

Subtitles in anime visual novels and VTuber streams must be instantly legible against high-contrast 3D backgrounds (bright lighting, dynamic character clothing, camera motion) without an opaque background box.

### 5.1 CSS Text Stroke & Multi-Directional Shadow Math
Using CSS `-webkit-text-stroke` alone produces rounded, hollow corners on certain character glyphs. The optimal solution combines a medium text stroke with four quadrant drop shadows:

```css
/* Deep black multi-pass outline for 100% legibility */
-webkit-text-stroke: 1.8px #0c0211;
text-shadow:
  -2px -2px 0 #0c0211,
   2px -2px 0 #0c0211,
  -2px  2px 0 #0c0211,
   2px  2px 0 #0c0211,
   0 3px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85);
```

### 5.2 Curated Anime Typefaces
- **Primary Font**: `Zen Kaku Gothic New` (Google Fonts) – clean geometric proportions, high Japanese & Latin glyph fidelity.
- **Secondary Font**: `M PLUS Rounded 1c` – rounded display stroke, friendly anime companion personality.
- **Fallback**: `sans-serif`.

### 5.3 Word State Color Palette
- **Upcoming Words**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)` (soft legible white).
- **Active Spoken Word**: `#ff3d8b` (Akari signature vibrant hot pink) with active pulse animation and `0 0 14px rgba(255, 60, 140, 0.95)` glow.
- **Completed Words**: `#ffffff` (crisp solid white).
